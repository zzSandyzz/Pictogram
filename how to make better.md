Here are a few ideas how to perfect this sloppy app.
First, taking photos from a picture bank is useless. It would be better to take the photos from the phone's memory/ to take all the pictures from a person's facebook page.
(In this case you could also add logging in with facebook)
Secondly, the feed looks ugly. It should be redesigned and more modern android technologies should be used.
Thirdly, the app has zero buttons which is simply unfriendly.
