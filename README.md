# Pictogram
picture  gallery

This is a fairly straightforward gallery app for Android. I made it for Yandex programming school enterence contest.

The idea is that the app takes a few pictures from https://picsum.photos/, and displays them as a feed. Once you tap on a picture it blows up and takes the full screen.
